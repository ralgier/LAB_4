# LAB_4
main goal is to get the linked list class created. Need to do it from scratch using his lecture notes or your brain
-#1 priortiy is creating a linked list that is functional 
-needs to have the necessary methods such as: add, remove, iterate, pritn, insert maybe more/less not 100%\
-then in the biol class you need to run whatever function it is and call the linked list to add the elements
--OVERALL STRUCTURE 

the whole thing is an array of objects,
size is set 
each object has a type and a linked list
--main goal is again to set the type and linked list propoerly using linked list methods 
ex) insert pos1 DNA ACCG
identify the command, at object1 of the array, set the type to DNA and the linked list to the sequence given
-in order to set the enum type look at first example done properly 
for setting the linked list type, use the methods you define in the linked list class to achieve

*extra things:
-sequence array all starts as null objects
-when you add, they become a type and not null
-when you remove at a position, the object does not return to null, it changes the type to unused 

		// make a method to get which command it is
		// make a method that takes in the command and then does what the command asks

		// enum
		// also stors linked list of characters we have to implement ourseles
		// define a class for element that has two fields, the type and the linked list

		// example String s = "insert 5 DNA Actg"
		// String[] avr = s.split("\\s+");
		// check what the word at index 1, to know what command it is
		// so for this one
		// class element
		// type shoudl be DNA and the linked list should be linkedList

		// dont do anything if the elemnets of the array are not valid inputs
